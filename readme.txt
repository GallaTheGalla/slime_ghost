The official overhaul of Slime.

Slime was originally made for the 2018 Ghost Jam event, which challenged devs to create a ghost within 62 hours. Thie first Ghost Jam had only 4 entries, and of them, Slime was the only original character!

I hope you all enjoy this new and improved version of a bit of English Ukagaka history.

Love you all,
Galla
